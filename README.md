<h1 align="center">Building Knowledge Repositories</h1>


On the Internet, there is a vast ocean of knowledge on different and varied topics. Most of this knowledge is either available online on the web or resides with the people as human knowledge. I want to create this repository as a platform to bind these scattered pieces of knowledge, spread over various websites at one place!
